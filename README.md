# Sending Emails with attachments
Sends an email with attachements

Just need to edit the settings.py file to enter your email address to which you are sending from and change the password to your email password. Once that is done, just edit the filename variable to the path of the file you want to send via attachment.

Thats it! a quick and simple script to send emails with python.
